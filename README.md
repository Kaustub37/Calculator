I made an arithmetic calculator using python and tkinter, which is a graphical user interface, or GUI. The python code is fairly simple and straight forward to calculate simple math functions such as addition and subtraction. The tkinter library allows for easy graphical layout of buttons for calculating arbitrary mathematical equations with some basic x-y inputting and displaying information such as the answer.
